-   Operating Systems
    -   Linux (https://korg.docs.kernel.org/gitolite/index.html); they moved to gitolite after kernel.org was compromised via a developer workstation in 2011 (https://lkml.org/lkml/2011/9/23/357)
    -   FreeBSD (unable to find a proper link, I only found out when they asked a question on the gitolite mailing list: https://groups.google.com/g/gitolite/c/6qdyDDBjJ30/m/e0RndHSQAQAJ)

    -   Fedora (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Package_Source_Control#Authorization)
