# gitolite overview

----

Gitolite allows you to setup git hosting on a central server, with
fine-grained access control and many more powerful features.

# what is gitolite?

Gitolite is an access control layer on top of git.  Here are the features that
most people see:

*   Use a single unix user ("real" user) on the server.
*   Provide access to many gitolite users:
    *   they are not "real" users,
    *   so they do not get shell access.
*   Control access to many git repositories:
    *   read access controlled at the repo level,
    *   write access controlled at the branch/tag/file/directory level,
        including who can rewind, create, and delete branches/tags.
*   Can be installed without root access, assuming git and perl are already
    installed.
*   Authentication is most commonly done using sshd, but you can also use
    "smart http" mode if you prefer (this may require root access for the
    initial setup).

# why might you need it?

## access control

Git by itself does not do any access control -- it relies on the transport
medium to do authentication ("who are you?"), and on OS file permissions to do
authorisation ("what are you allowed to do?").

Git also comes with a program called "git-shell" which can act as a restricted
login shell if you don't want users getting a proper shell.  Using this and
judicious use of Unix groups, you can allow some people read-only access while
others get read-write access, etc.  This is probably sufficient if your needs
are simple and don't change too often.

However, gitolite does this much better, and offers many more features.

### basic use case

Gitolite is useful in any server that is going to host multiple git
repositories, each with many developers, where "anyone can do anything to any
repo" is not a good idea.  Here're two examples to illustrate.

----

This first example has 3 repos and 3 developers with different levels of
access to each repo.  It's a very simple, readable, syntax, and makes it easy
to answer questions like "what repos can bob push to" (answer: only 'bar').

```gitolite
repo foo
    RW+     =   alice
    RW      =   carol

repo bar
    RW+     =   bob
    R       =   alice

repo baz
    RW+     =   carol
    R       =   alice bob
```

----

This second example allows different levels of access to different branches
and tags for different developers:

```gitolite
repo foo
    RW+                         =   alice
    RW  master                  =   bob
    RW+ dev/                    =   bob
    RW  refs/heads/tags/v[0-9]  =   ashok
```

## other features

Gitolite has many more features, as you might guess from the amount of
documentation (see links in the nav bar at the top).  Here's a quick sample:

*   Very powerful rule language (rules most often based on branch/tag name, or
    files/directories touched, but many other factors can be used, such as
    size of changed files, number of changed files, etc.).
*   Convenience features for writing the rules (repo groups, user groups, get
    user group info from LDAP, include files, macros...)
*   Highly customisable and scriptable, especially custom commands for users.
    Many built-in commands and options.
*   Powerful and flexible mirroring system.
*   Users can create their own repos and set access rights (if you allow
    them).

## alternatives to gitolite

### unix permissions and ACLs

If you're a masochist, you could probably do example 1 with Unix permissions
and facls.  But you can't do example 2 -- git is not designed to allow that!

Here are some other disadvantages of the Unix ACL method:

*   Every user needs a userid and password on the server.
*   Changing access rights involves complex `usermod -G ...` mumblings
    (I.e., the "pain" mentioned above is not a one-time pain!)
*   *Viewing* the current set of permissions requires running multiple
    commands to list directories and their permissions/ownerships, users and
    their group memberships, and then correlating all these manually.
*   Auditing historical permissions or permission changes is impossible.

### Gerrit Code Review

The best real alternative to gitolite is Gerrit Code Review.  If code review
is an essential part of your workflow, you should use Gerrit.

Here're some high level differences between gitolite and Gerrit (as of about
mid-2012 or so):

**Size**: 3000+ lines of perl versus of 56,000+ lines of Java

**Architecture**: Gitolite sits on top of "standard" git and openssh, which
are assumed to already be installed.  Gerrit includes its own git stack (jgit)
and sshd (Apache Mina).  In Java tradition, they all come bundled together.

(Corollary: As far as I know jgit does not support the same hooks that 'man
githooks' talks about).

Gitolite uses a plain text config file; gerrit uses a database.

**User view**: Gitolite is invisible to users except when access is denied.
Gerrit is much more visible to devs because of its role in enforcing code
review, approvals, and workflow.

On a related note, gitolite does not do anything special with signed or
annotated tags, nor does it check author/committer identity.  However, it is
trivial to add your own code to do either (or if someone contributes it, to
just "enable" what ships with gitolite in a disabled state).

### gitlab, gogs, gitblit, and others

There are several alternatives which offer a full web-based GUI, for
administrators or users or both.  They also offer a lot of enterprise features
(for example LDAP integration), and social coding features (issue trackers,
discussions, comments on code, pull requests, etc.)

However, they are unlikely to be as [customisable](non-core) as gitolite is,
if you care about that sort of thing.

# how does it work?

At a very high level, gitolite relies on **sshd** (or **httpd** if you're
using the smart http mode) to authenticate the user and supply the username.
Based on this, and the command given, it decides whether to allow or deny the
request.

Consider a push command in ssh mode.  Normally (i.e., without gitolite) this
would invoke `git-receive-pack` on the server, and the flow would be somewhat
like this (left side is client, right side is server):

![](ov01.png)

----

When you install gitolite and setup the user, gitolite sets up ssh to
**force** the `gitolite-shell` command to run first, instead of the command
requested:

The `gitolite-shell` program uses the username supplied by ssh, and the repo
name in the command, to decide if the user has write access to the repo or
not.

If he does have *some* write access, git-receive-pack is called, but that's
not the end of the story.  The branch/tag/file(s) he is pushing also need to
be checked, and gitolite sets up the update hook on the repo to do that.

    If you're using gitolite and find it very useful in some way, I would love
    to describe your use of it or add a link to your own description of it
    here.  Of course, you can anonymise it as much as you need to.

**NOTE**: some of the links below may be outdated/bit-rotted.  As I find new links or someone points me to them I'll post them here with an approximate date.  (I'll keep the old text/links as-is for now).

The **Fedora Project** controls access to over 10,000 package management
repositories accessed by over 1,000 package maintainers [using
gitolite][fedora].  This is probably the largest *confirmed* gitolite
installation anywhere.  The whole "big-config" option back in v2 (in v3
this is the default!) was initially done for them (their config file was so
big that without the big-config changes gitolite would just run out of memory
and die!).

The **KDE project** [uses][kde] gitolite (in combination with redmine for
issue tracking and reviewboard for code review).  Apart from the usual access
control, the KDE folks are heavy users of the "ad hoc repo creation" features
enabled by wildrepos and the accompanying commands.  Several of the changes to
the "admin defined commands" were also inspired by KDE's needs.  See [section
5][kdes5] and [section 6][kdes6] of the above linked page for details.

**Prof. Hiren Patel** of the University of Waterloo is responsible for the
existence of the fairly popular "[wildrepos](wild)" feature.  The
documentation was pretty much written with his use case in mind, but of course
it turns out to be useful for a lot of people, as you can see from the
previous para on KDE's use of gitolite.

In fact, he surprised the heck out of me once by saying that if it hadn't been
for this feature, he might not have used git itself -- which is a pretty
serious compliment if you think about the magnitude of the git project and my
little one-man show!

He explains his use of it [here][hiren].

**Gentoo Linux** has [just moved][gentoo1] their git repositories from gitosis
to gitolite. There are about 200 repositories, some of them are the so called
[overlays][gentoo2], official and unofficial/user overlays, plus several
developer and project repositories, used by more than 1000 people. That number
will be increased in the near future, as they are going to migrate some of
their CVS/SVN repositories there, plus they are offering overlays hosting for
users as well.

**kernel.org**, the official distribution point for the Linux kernel, is the
latest (as of 2011-10) high-visibility installation.  According to [this
email][ko-ann] to the lkml, kernel.org decided to use gitolite for access
controlling their git repos.  ~~Their [FAQ entry][ko-why] describes at a high
level why they chose gitolite.~~ (this link no longer has that info; see up above for some newer links).

This move also prompted the first ever security audit of gitolite by an
outside party.  Gitolite did great; see [here][audit] for details.  [NOTE: v3
has not had such an audit yet; if you did one, please let me know what you
found.  If you want to do one and need clarifications on anything or general
background let me know].

In addition, kernel.org was responsible for a serious rethink of a few rough
edges in gitolite, and smoothing them out was fun (the "playing with gitolite"
stuff, making the test suite simpler, "deny" rules for the entire repo).

The **Mageia Project** is [using][mageia-gitweb] gitolite 3 to manage its
git repositories and access control. The repositories are [defined][mageia-def]
in yaml files. A tool called [mgagit][mgagit] has been created and is
repsonsible for the generation of the gitolite configuration from the
yaml repos definitions, and the extraction of users' ssh keys from an
ldap directory into the gitolite configuration.

Gitolite and mgagit are installed using rpm packages and
[a puppet module][mageia-puppet].

A general note: if you see the list of high-profile users above, you will see
that gitolite benefits as much as they do; possibly more.
